    ./paramsets/ contains a set of example paramset files. Fill in your desired parameter values into the cells of the csv file. Be sure to stick to S.I. units while entering parameters. 

2. Change directories in the simulation.py file
    change the OUTPUT_DIR (directory where the output is to be saved) and the PARAMETER_FILE_DIR (directory of the parameter file)

3. Run the simulation.py file
    this runs one instance of the simulation.
